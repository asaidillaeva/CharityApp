## Description
Charity is one of the aspects of being human. 
Our parents teach us that we should help each other and should give them what we have. 
Most people think that only rich people can help others, because they have enough money, but it is not.
Even small help means a lot to others. Our team decides to make the platform, where anyone can help and get help.
